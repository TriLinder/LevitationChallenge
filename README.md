# Levitation Challenge

Just a simple challenge datapack I made for me and my friend, don't expect anything super polished.



**How to use:**

 	1. Install the datapack
 	2. Change settings in the `levSettings` scoreboard.
 	3. Add players by giving them the tag `levPlayer`,  `/tag UserName add levPlayer` 
 	4. Remove players by removing their tag, `/tag UserName remove levPlayer`
 	5. Enjoy!
